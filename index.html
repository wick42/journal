                        <p>It's all coming back to me... kind of. Fifteen years ago I did some work with website design and html. I had mostly done work with SQL Server and MS Access front ends in the years before. I only ended up doing the database work because I had an aptitude with computers and understood the database stuff more than the other people on my team at the marketing firm where I was working at the time. <br/>
                        I did the web development work for a few years until I got married, had kids, and became a stay at home dad. Now my youngest is ready to go to kindergarten and I thought I would see if I could catch up to the changes in web development in the last decade. The HTML was familiar but CSS was only starting to be used widely when I last touched code. It hasn't been totally incomprehensible so I'm optimistic.

                        <p>The second week had some hiccups with floats and git, but Treehouse, Al and Nathan helped clear those up. I didn't wireframe the site very well before I dove into the code so I had to start over to have a hope of keeping my code compact and readable. Once I had a better plan I made some good progress on the Journal website struture and design, but content is my albatross. I really don't like writing out my thoughts and processes. I've been told many times how much it can help in various ways, but I've always prefered to internalize and stew on things until the light bulb goes off. I'll just think of these as commit messages and maybe that will help.<br/>
